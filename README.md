# Scriptures of the Restoration

The Durham 2nd ward's 2017 goal is to have every member read one of the scriptures of the restoration during the yearâ€”either the [Book of Mormon](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm) or the [Doctrine and Covenants](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament).

This repository contains code for generating the [goal's website](http://scripturesoftherestoration.org) with [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/). It also includes code for generating the weekly reading lists with [R](https://www.r-project.org/).
